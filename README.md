In depth analysis of COVID-19

A note about using filters: 
Filters can sometimes give an impression of incorrect analysis if not used/understood properly. Here's a brief explanation on how to use it to get maximam insight. 
Filters try to filter the result(data) based on the choosen filtering(matching) criteria.Its like creating a vizualisation for a query with certain predicates(conditions). For example, using the slider to see result for the number of "confirmed cases(cumulative)" below 20,000 and just selecting the Month as "March" might end up in fetching an empty screen or no result. This is because for the month of March the sum of "Confirmed Cases" had already surpassed that number and there's no time series(or fetched data) that satisfy the search criteria or the query conditions(confirmed cases<20,000 and Month=March). This can be verified by the fact that as soon as one chooses the month prior to March(February/January or both) the time series(or data) that fits into the filtering criteria gets popped up since for the month of Febraury there is some result that satisfy the give predicate(filtering criteria).
