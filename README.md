In depth analysis of COVID-19

A note about using filters: 
Filters can sometimes give an impression of incorrect analysis if not used/understood properly. Here's a brief explanation on how to use them to get better insights. 
Filters try to filter the result(data) based on the choosen filtering(matching) criteria. It tries to create the vizualisation for the query, having certain predicates(conditions). For example, setting the slider for the number of "confirmed cases(cumulative)" below 20,000 for China and just selecting the Month as "March" might end up in an empty screen or no result. This is because for China for the in the month of March the sum of "Confirmed Cases" had already surpassed that number and there's no time series(or fetched data) that satisfy the search criteria or the query conditions(confirmed cases<20,000,Month=March and Country=China). This can be verified by the fact that as soon as one chooses the month prior to that(February/January or both) the time series(or data) that fits into the filtering criteria pops up since for the month of Febraury there is some result that satisfy the give predicate(filtering criteria/condition).
